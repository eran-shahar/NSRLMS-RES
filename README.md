# NSRLMS-RES
This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of the RES model proposed in the paper "ACOUSTIC ECHO CANCELLATION WITH THE NORMALIZED SIGN REGRESSOR LEAST
MEAN SQUARES ALGORITHM AND DEEP RESIDUAL ECHO SUPPRESSION". 

Under 'Audio examples' can be found some .wav files with examples of the model's outputs, along with the outputs of the other methods compared in the paper.
